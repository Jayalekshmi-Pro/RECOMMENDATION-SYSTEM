Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a personalized Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering or Matrix Factorization techniques. The system should be capable of suggesting relevant items (such as movies, products, books, etc.) to users based on their historical preferences and similarities with other users or items. The final deliverable will be an interactive notebook or web-based application that showcases recommendation results, visual insights, and evaluation metrics.
Recommendation systems have become a core component of online platforms like Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, and YouTube. Their purpose is to help users discover content they are likely to enjoy by filtering vast amounts of information and tailoring the experience to individual preferences. There are two primary types of recommendation techniques:
Content-Based Filtering – recommends items based on user preferences for item features.
Collaborative Filtering – recommends items based on user-user or item-item interactions (without requiring explicit features).
This project focuses on Collaborative Filtering, particularly the use of Matrix Factorization, which is one of the most effective and scalable techniques used in modern recommender systems.

Dataset:
The dataset used may be one of the standard public datasets such as:
MovieLens (user ratings of movies)
Goodbooks-10k (book ratings)
Retail datasets (product purchase interactions) the dataset will typically contain user IDs, item IDs, and a rating or interaction value (explicit like a 1-5 rating or implicit like a click/view).Before building the model, the data will be preprocessed:
Removing duplicates and sparsity
Splitting into training and test sets
Converting into user-item interaction matrices

Modeling Approach:
Two main techniques will be implemented:
User-Based or Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:
Measures similarity between users or items using cosine similarity or Pearson correlation.
Predicts ratings based on the weighted average of ratings from similar users/items.
Matrix Factorization (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition - SVD):
Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional latent factor matrices.
Captures hidden features that represent user preferences and item characteristics.
Can be trained using libraries like Surprise, LightFM, or implicit.
Additional regularization techniques and hyperparameter tuning will be applied to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.

Evaluation Metrics:
The recommendation system will be evaluated using:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) – measures accuracy of predicted ratings
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Precision@K and Recall@K – for Top-K recommendation quality
Coverage and Diversity – how broad and varied the recommendations are
Cross-validation and train-test splits will be used to validate the robustness of the model.

Deliverables:
A fully functional Jupyter notebook or web app (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask) that:
Loads and preprocesses the data
Trains a recommendation model
Displays top recommendations for selected users
Visualizes user-item interactions and similarities
Shows evaluation metrics
A report or markdown cell documentation explaining:
Data preparation
Model design and algorithm choice
Evaluation methodology
Interpretation of results and future improvement suggestions
